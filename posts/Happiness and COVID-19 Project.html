<h1>World Happiness and COVID-19 Pandemic: How Do We Feel?</h1>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic upended the lives of nearly every person across the globe. With mandated goverment shelter-in-places, contested vaccination policies, and overwhelmed medical systems and professionals, 2019-2021 was a challenging time for all countries. Mental health professionals reported record levels of depression and anxiety. To understand the root of discontent, a broad analysis across countries during the pandemic years will be conducted to pinpoint trends, factors, and correlations between world happiness and COVID-19 pandemic severity. The findings are to be used to create a better response to the next global pandemic.</p>

<p>The columns do not appear to add up overall score. Cross-referencing the 2019 World Happiness Report, the missing factor contributing to the happiness score is Dystopia and residual. An additional column is added to the whr19 dataframe to account for Dystopia and Residual, in order to have a complete dataset for data visualization.</p>

<p>A good way to understand the data stored within WHR19 is to create a segmented bar chart for each country, where each bar shows the breakdown of their happiness ladder score. The bar chart is effective at displaying the range of ladder scores and the contributions of each happiness factor toward scores.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="world-happiness-reports-data-cleaning-standardization-and-consolidation">World Happiness Reports: Data Cleaning, Standardization, and Consolidation</h3>
<p>The world happiness datasets for 2019-2021 vary in what data is presented. The 2019 dataset is particularly different from the 2020 and 2021 datasets, as it only contains the data processed to show each factorâ€™s direct contribution to the happiness score. In the 2020 and 2021 datasets, direct contributions as well as raw data is shown. Furthermore, across all 3 datasets, the number of countries for which data is available varies, meaning there may be some countries that are represented in 2019 but not 2020, and so on.</p>
<p>For some forms of analysis, it is beneficial to consolidate all three dataframes into one dataframe. In order to create a dataframe containing consistent information that can be easily grouped, columns and entries must be named in the same manner.</p>
<p>Country names, in particular, must be renamed in a fashion that is consistent across all three dataframes. There must be an agreed-upon spelling/name of each country. Since one of the research questions inquires about geographical trends, a sensible country-naming model to use would be the folium country list since the package is likely to be used in analysis later.</p>
<p>Consistent country naming allows for dataframes to be merged by country name properly. Merging two consecutive year WHR datasets provides a dataframe that can be used easily to analyze data specific to each country per year interval, which is helpful for answering research questions analyzing change over time.</p>
<p>Merging 3 dataframes can be messy and lead to complications for some data visualizations, so concatenating the 3 world happiness can be helpful. To do so, a column containing information about the year of the data is added. Columns that are not present in all 3 dataframes are dropped as the data is not very helpful when absent across some rows. A single dataframe with three yearsâ€™ of WHR data is especially helpful for plotting 3-year average values.</p>

<p>In order to use the COVID-19 data in conjunction with the WHR data, especially when plotting data by country, it is important that the COVID dataset uses the same country naming convention as the WHRs. Again, the country naming will be set to the folium geodata standard, since it was used as the standard in all three WHR dataframes.</p>
<p>It is important to check that countries outside of the folium geodata are consistently named with other countries in the WRH datasets that also are not in the folium database. Then, the COVID dataframe is ready to be merged with the WHR datasets by country name. The merged dataframe will be a helpful resource when analyzing the relationship between COVID severity and happiness scores.</p>

Which countries had the greatest positive and negative shifts in happiness?</h4>
<p>Boxplots of the happiness ladder score can be used to analyze general shifts in happiness. A general decrease in happiness could be represented by a lower mean; a general increase in happiness could be represented by a higher mean.</p>
<p>According to the statistics and data descriptions, the mean and max happiness scores appear to increase each year. However, the lowest happiness scores are smaller as well. This means that between 2019-2021, some countries increased their happiness scores while others decreased their happiness scores.</p>
<p>The results do not strongly indicate that happiness increased or decreased during the pandemic and it is not possible to distinguish how many countries became more happy, remained neutral, or grew less happy. To calculate change per country, the happiness scores between two consecutive years are subtracted.The merged dataframe between two years ensures that the same two countries are being compared year to year.</p>
<p>Between 2019 and 2020, the mean change in happiness is negative, which indicates that general countries became less happy. The most positive change in happiness is 0.63, which corresponds to Afghanistan on the horizontal bar chart. Afghanistan therefore was the country that gained the most happiness between 2019 and 2020. The most negative change in happiness is -0.58, which corresponds to Liberia on the horizontal bar chart. Liberia therefore was the country that lost the most happiness between 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>Between 2020 and 2021, the mean change in happiness is negative, which indicates that generally countries became less happy. The most positive change in happiness is 0.76, which corresponds to Pakistan on the horizontal bar chart. Pakistan therefore was the country that gained the most happiness between 2020 and 2021. The most negative change in happiness is -0.61, which corresponds to Armenia on the horizontal bar chart. Armenia therefore was the country that lost the most happiness between 2020 and 2021.</p>

<section id="how-did-happiness-factors-shift-and-affect-happiness-scores-between-2019-2021" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-did-happiness-factors-shift-and-affect-happiness-scores-between-2019-2021">How did happiness factors shift and affect happiness scores between 2019-2021?</h4>
<p>To investigate how shifting happiness factors impact happiness scores, insight is needed regarding the relationship between each factor and the happiness score.</p>
<p>The factors GDP per capita, Social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life decisions have a general direct relationship with happiness ladder; it appears that these four factors are play a critical role in determining happiness score such that a higher value in any of those factors are correlated with a higher overall happiness score. On the other hand, generosity and perception of corruption do not appear to have a clear relationship; higher values do not necessarily indicate a higher happiness score.</p>
<p>Thus, understanding how GDP per capita, Social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life decisions have shifted between 2019-2021 is key to understanding how happiness scores have changed through the pandemic.</p>
<p>The contributing factor of GDP per Capita decreased in 2020 before increasing in 2021. The 2021 values are higher than the 2019 values. Based on the relationship between GDP contribution and happiness score, the decreased GDP in 2020 likely lowered the average happiness score of 2020 while the increased GDP in 2021 likely raised the average happiness score of 2021.</p>
<p>The decreased GDP in 2020 may be explained by local economies suffering during government mandated lock-downs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many were not able to leave their homes and were laid off, so it is likely that people only bought the bare necessities. In 2021, many businesses began operating as normal again, likely causing an increase in GDP.</p>
<p>The contributing factor of Social Support decreased every year from 2019-2021. Based on the relationship between social support and happiness score, the decreasing contribution of social support likely lowered the average happiness score of 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>The decreased social support contribution values coincide with themes of social distancing and weariness toward interacting with strangers during the pandemic. It would be reasonable for the social support factor to decrease due to lowered interactions with the community in general.</p>
<p>The contributing factor of healthy life expectancy decreased every year from 2019-2021. Based on the relationship between healthy life expectancy and happiness score, the decreasing contribution of social support likely lowered the average happiness score of 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>The decrease in healthy life expectancy may be explained by the high death rates from COVID-19. A majority of cases during the pandemic occurred during 2020, which may be a reason for the major decrease in healthy life expectancy in 2021.</p>
<p>The contributing factor of freedom to make life choices increased every year from 2019-2021. Based on the relationship between freedom to make life choices and happiness score, the increasing contribution of social support likely raised the average happiness score of 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>The increased sense of freedom to make life choices is a surprising trend as the many governments mandated lock-downs and vaccinations during the pandemic, which was often perceived as an overreach of power. There is a possibility that the freedom to make life choices may have increased due to increased flexibility in work culture, although the freedom is only applicable to certain groups within the work force.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-a-correlation-between-covid-19-pandemic-severity-and-happiness-score">Is there a correlation between COVID-19 pandemic severity and happiness score?</h4>
<p>Some countries experienced larger COVID case volumes per capita than others. It is expected that countries with more cases per capita have a lower happiness due to the impact of COVID on the happiness factors.</p>
<p>First, COVID severity and happiness scores by country can be visualized using a map. The toggles on the side allow the user to chose what to view. If a country has a dark ladder score color but a light COVID case per capita cover, it indicates a high happiness factor for a low case per capita count.</p>
<p>Some countries, such as Canada, indicate low COVID cases per capita and a high happiness score, However, it is difficult to discern a trend from the visual.</p>
<p>To analyze whether the relationship between COVID cases per capita and happiness score, a scattergraph can be plotted to visualize correlation.</p>
<p>The R-squared value is relatively low and close to zero, indicating weak linear correlation between covid cases and happiness score. The scattergraph data also does not appear to follow any other polynomial fit. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn about COVID-case severity and happiness score at this time.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>To conclude, the findings from the data analysis are as follows:</p>
<p><strong><em>How has happiness by country shifted between 2019-2021, the time frame of the COVID-19 pandemic? Which countries had the greatest positive and negative shifts in happiness?</em></strong></p>
<p>The max happiness score between 2019-21 appears to increase very slightly each year. The mean and minimum happiness score betwen 2019-21 appears to decrease each year. However, the number of countries that increased or decreased in happiness nor the extent of each countryâ€™s shift in happiness can be determined by examining the mean, max, and minimum happiness scores.</p>
<p>Between 2019-20, Afghanistan had the greatest positive shift in happiness while Liberia had the most negative shift in happiness. Between 2020-21, Pakistan had the greatest positive shift in happiness while Armenia had the most negative shift in happiness.</p>
<p><strong><em>How did happiness factors shift and affect happiness scores between 2019-2021?</em></strong></p>
<p>The factors GDP per capita, Social support, healthy life expectancy, and freedom to make life decisions appear to have a direct relationship with the happiness score such that an high value in any of the four factors usually indicates a higher-level happiness score. Generosity and perception of corruption do not appear to have a clear relationship with happiness scores such that high values in either factors did not necessarily correlate with high happiness scores. Thus, the shifts in generosity and perception of corruption were not examined for their impacts on the happiness scores between 2019-21.</p>

<p><strong><em>Is there a correlation between happiness score and COVID-19 severity?</em></strong></p>
<p>The scattergraph of Covid Cases per Capita vs Happiness Score does not have a linear fit, as evidenced by a low R-squared value. There may be other correlations, but the scattergraph does not appear to follow any polynomial fits at this time.</p>

<section id="importance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance">Importance</h2>
<p>The findings are valuable in a variety of ways. Happiness should be one of the top priorties of every government; understanding how pandemics impact happiness factors is critical for creating action plans for the next pandemic that may hit. For example, the major decrease in social support during the pandemic must be addressed: how might countries upkeep a social network for citizens when they must stay socially distanced?</p>
<p>The findings reveal that case per capita severity is not a sole indicator of country happiness. It is possible for countries with low case counts to be on the lower end of the happiness spectrum, and it is possible for countries with high case counts to be on the higher end of the happiness spectrum. The lack of correlation suggests that country happiness during a pandemic may depend on other factors, such as country response and support systems in place.</p>
<p>Understanding the factors of happiness and their changes during the pandemic is also valuable for mental health professionals. During the pandemic, numerous studies reported a plunge in mental health and an overwhelmed mental health indsutry. By being aware of what may be the root of many clientsâ€™ problems, mental health specialists are better able to address the issues and suggest preventative or resolutionary measures.</p>

<section id="future-analysis-and-considerations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-analysis-and-considerations">Future Analysis and Considerations</h2>
<p>It is important to note that the results of this study are limited. A potential source of error includes inconsistent country participation in world happiness surveys. Due to the pandemic, survey response collection was hindered in some countries. This may lead to a skew toward results from countries that are faring better than average. Future studies may opt to eliminate data from countries not present in all three survey years between 2019-21 to reduce error. Additionally, data for COVID cases could be sourced from a larger time range; the data readily available and used in this analysis only covers the range of 12/2019-12/2020.</p>
<p>While conducting this data analysis, it became evident that there are many factors that can tie into the results. A wholistic and multi-faceted study is necessary to fully assess the dynamic of happiness scores during a pandemic. Government response to pandemics, medical ability and accessibillity per country, and cultural differences in evaluating happiness are just a few additional factors that could be considered.</p>
